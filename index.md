## Welcome to LukCoding's Datapack site!

You can install the pack by downloading the zip file from the button in the menu and then extracting the .zip.
When you extract this, you get a folder. Inside this folder, there's another folder. Now open a new file explorer window and into the top, enter %appdata%/.minecraft/saves/WORLDNAME/datapacks. Now move the other folder into this folder and now restart your game and now my message will appear in the chat. Now you can start using my datapack!
